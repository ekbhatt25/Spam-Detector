# Spam Detector LSTM Neural Network

This project uses a LSTM-based deep learning model - a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) - developed on Jupyter in Python under sequential modeling to accurately detect spam emails from a balanced dataset of labeled messages. It leverages a bidirectional LSTM and droupout regularization to achieve a 98.5% accuracy and a 0.0725 test loss.

Key features include text preprocessing (punctuation & stopword removal), tokenization and sequence padding, word cloud visualizations, EarlyStopping and learning rate decay to optimize training. Technologies include TensorFlow, Pandas, Keras, Natural Language Toolkit for preprocessing, Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
